**Battleship (simplified):** This game is a one-player game, versus the computer. The computer randomly generates an 8x8 board with 5 ships of size 4 placed on the board. The ships may not overlap and can be placed vertically or horizontally. A player chooses a cell within the board to throw a bomb. The computer reports whether the bomb hit a ship, or fell in the water. If all cells of a ship have been bombed, the ship sinks which is also reported. When all ships are sunk, the player wins. The score can be represented by the number of bombs that fell in the water.
